# Components
Most of the content on a site is created with [ACF Blocks](/docs/blocks/acf-blocks/README.md), but occasionally there will be elements that are used across multiple places on the site but don't exist as their own unique block. These can be created as components and are used to reduce code duplication.

Components can be reusable PHP, SCSS, or JS, and the file structure is similar to ACF blocks. However, a component can also exist purely as SCSS or JS and doesn't always need a php file.
