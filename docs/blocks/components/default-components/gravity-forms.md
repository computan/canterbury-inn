# Gravity Forms
This component contains default styles specific to the form markup from Gravity Forms. For projects using a different form system, make sure this component is not being included in the CSS Deps for any project (do a regex search for `CSS Deps.*gravity-forms` in VS Code). By default, this only needs to be changed in the [acf/form block](/themes/catapult/blocks/acf-blocks/form/block.php).
